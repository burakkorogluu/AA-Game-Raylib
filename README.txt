AA GAME
GAMEPLAY:
When we first open the game, we enter our name on the screen and press the ENTER key to log in.
Then, we click the START button to begin the game.

We are greeted by a rotating circle. We shoot our small balls onto the rotating circle by pressing the SPACE key.
Be careful! The ball must not touch the other balls.

If it touches, you’ll see a FAILED screen — click the START button on that screen to retry the same level.
If you successfully shoot all your balls without touching, then a PASSED screen will appear.
On this screen, click the CONTINUE button to move on to the next levels.

You can view the menu at any time by clicking the MENU button.
In the menu screen:

Click COLOUR THEME to switch between different themes,

Click SOUND ON/OFF to mute or unmute the game,

Click BEST SCORES to view the top scores in the game,

Click RESET to reset your game progress,

Click CLOSE MENU to exit the menu.

If you want to exit the game at any moment, simply click the EXIT button in the top right corner.
