# 🎮 AA GAME

## 🕹️ GAMEPLAY:
When we first open the game, we **enter our name** on the screen and press the **ENTER** key to log in.  
Then, we click the **START** button to begin the game.  

We are greeted by a **rotating circle**. We **shoot our small balls** onto the rotating circle by pressing the **SPACE** key.  
⚠️ Be careful! The ball **must not touch** the other balls.  

If it touches, you’ll see a **FAILED** screen — click the **START** button on that screen to retry the same level.  
If you successfully shoot all your balls without touching, then a **PASSED** screen will appear.  
On this screen, click the **CONTINUE** button to move on to the next levels.  

You can view the **menu** at any time by clicking the **MENU** button.
